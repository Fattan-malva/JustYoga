# TODO: Fix Type Error for Null Teachers in Schedule

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update `lib/models/schedule_item.dart`: Change `teacher1` from `String` to `String?` in the class definition and constructor.
- [x] Update `lib/screens/pages/schedule_screen.dart`: Modify the trainer display text to handle null `teacher1` using null coalescing operator (`?? 'N/A'`).

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Run the Flutter app and test with schedule data where `Teacher1` is null to ensure no type errors occur.
